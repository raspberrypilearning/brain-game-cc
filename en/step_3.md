## Add a timer

--- task ---
Create a countdown timer on the Stage with the help of a new variable called `time`{:class="block3variables"}. The timer should begin at 30 seconds and count down to 0 seconds.

Create a `variable`{:class="block3variables"}, call it 'time', and set its value to `30`.

Then add code to count `time`{:class="block3variables"} down to 0 within 30 seconds. To do this, subtract `1` from `time`{:class="block3variables"} every `1` second, and repeat this until `time`{:class="block3variables"} equals `0`.

Here are the blocks you need:

```blocks3
repeat until < >

end

wait (1) seconds

change [time v] by (1)

(time)

when flag clicked

<() = ()>

set [time v] to [0]
```

Here is the what your new code should look like:
```blocks3
when flag clicked
set [time v] to [30]
repeat until <(time) = (0)>
    wait (1) seconds
    change [time v] by (-1)
end
```

Create a `broadcast`{:class="block3control"} that sends the message 'end'. A `broadcast`{:class="block3control"} is like an announcement over a loudspeaker: it can be heard by all of your sprites. Add the `broadcast`{:class="block3control"} block to the end of the timer code so that the code will send and 'end' message when the `time`{:class="block3variables"} has counted down to `0`.

```blocks3
    broadcast (end v)
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Select your character sprite and add some code so that the sprite `stops the other scripts`{:class="block3control"} when it receives the `end`{:class="block3control"} message.

```blocks3
    when I receive [end v]
    stop [other scripts in sprite v]
```

Test your game again. It should continue to ask questions until the timer has counted down to 0.
