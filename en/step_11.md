## What next?

Try the [Catch the dots](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-dots?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project to create a reaction game! In that project, you're going to learn how to make clones of sprites, and how to use a variable to gradually speed up the game.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to rotate the controller wheel and catch the flying dots as they reach the centre. If you miss three dots, the game is over.
