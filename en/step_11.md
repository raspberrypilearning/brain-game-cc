## What next?

Go to the Skills in Careers activity and then go to the next project on the module pathway, 'Catch the dots', to create a reaction game! In that project, you're going to learn how to make clones of sprites, and how to use a variable to gradually speed up the game.

You will find this project in the module pathway.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to rotate the controller wheel and catch the flying dots as they reach the centre. If you miss three dots, the game is over.
